The steps to building and using a model are:

Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
Predict: Just what it sounds like
Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.

Model Validity -> predictive accuracy as a measure of quality
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) -> average of absolute value of each error (actual - predicted)
- In-sample scores are bad (same sample for building and eval)

Underfitting/Overfitting
- leaves with few houses make predictions close to house value 
    - unreliable for new data -> overfitting
- model not capturing patterns, bad on training data -> underfitting
- max_leaf_nodes argument

Here's the takeaway: Models can suffer from either:

Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.
- validation data measures a candidate model's accuracy. this lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.
