Chapter 2 Mathematical building blocks of neural networks

- Tensors are buckets of numbers of a specific shape and a certain rank (dimensionality)
    > can be interpreted as a 3d array?
    > vector 1d, matrix 2d, tensor 3d+ (numpy.txt)

- Class: category in classification problem
- Samples: Data points
- Label: class associated with specific sample
- Layer: filter for data (data-processing module that extracts representations)

Compilation:
- loss function: network uses to measure performance on training data 
- optimizer: way for network to update itself based on data and loss function 

Workflow:
1. feed training data into neural network
2. ask network to make predictions
3. verify conditions labels
